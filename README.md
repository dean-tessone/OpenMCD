7. **Extract Features (optional)**
   - Click "Extract Features"
   - Select acquisitions (or all with masks) and feature sets
   - Choose an output directory/filename or keep results in memory
   - The results DataFrame includes both `acquisition_id` and `acquisition_label` for clarity

8. **Cell Clustering Analysis (optional)**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"readimc is not installed" error**
   - Ensure readimc is installed: `pip install readimc>=0.9.0`

2. **Cellpose/GPU segmentation not available**
   - Cellpose is optional. Install to enable segmentation: `pip install cellpose`
   - For CUDA GPUs, also install PyTorch with CUDA (see PyTorch install guide)
   - On Apple Silicon, MPS is auto-detected when available

3. **PyQt5 installation issues**
   - On some systems, you may need to install PyQt5 separately:
   - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5`
   - macOS: `brew install pyqt5`

4. **Display issues**
   - Ensure your system supports the required OpenGL version for PyQt5
   - Try running with different Qt backends if needed 

5. **Memory issues with large files**
   - The application includes caching, but very large datasets may require more RAM
   - Consider closing other applications to free up memory

6. **Multiprocessing during feature extraction**
   - The app uses multiprocessing where possible; if it fails, it falls back to single-threaded processing automatically
   - If you see pickling-related errors, ensure you start via `python main.py` (not from within embedded REPLs)

7. **Clustering and UMAP dependencies**
   - For Leiden clustering: Install `leidenalg` and `python-igraph`: `pip install leidenalg python-igraph`
   - For UMAP visualization: Install `umap-learn`: `pip install umap-learn`
   - For enhanced visualizations: Install `seaborn`: `pip install seaborn`
   - These are optional - the app will work without them but clustering features will be limited

8. **Memory issues with large clustering datasets**
   - UMAP and clustering can be memory-intensive for large cell populations (>10,000 cells)
   - Consider subsampling your data or using fewer features if you encounter memory issues
   - The app includes progress indicators for long-running clustering operations
